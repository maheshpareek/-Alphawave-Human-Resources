        <h5 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2"> Competency Assessment and Mapping:</h5>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3"> Competency mapping is a process of identifying key competencies for an organization or job and incorporating 
those competencies throughout business processes of organization.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>How we deliver this?&nbsp;<br>
          <br>We have a step by step procedure developed to get this job done. Following are the steps involved:
        </p>
        <ul class="u-text u-text-4">
          <li> We conduct job analysis for a particular position.</li>
          <li>On the basis of the results of the above job analysis we develop a competence based job description.</li>
          <li>Then we map the developed competences through all the processes.</li>
          <li>Then we assess the competency of the existing employees of that particular position and match the results
 with our mapping.</li>
          <li>Then we identify the gaps and suggest the measures to rectify the same.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-5"> Employee satisfaction survey:</h5>
        <p class="u-text u-text-6"> Herein we basically conduct surveys to find out whether the employees are happy and contended and whether 
their needs and desires relating to the work are fulfilled or not.<br>
          <br>We always develop a customize survey questionnaire depending on the needs of the clients. We understand the 
sensitivity of the data we will be dealing with hence we ensure 100% anonymity so that the results are taken 
positively and the employee morale and workplace conditions are enhanced.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h5 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-7"> Psychometric Testing:</h5>
        <p class="u-text u-text-8"> Psychometric testing are standard and scientific methods designed to measure candidates suitability for a role based 
on the required personality, characteristic, and aptitude. They identify the extent to which candidate's personality 
and cognitive ability match those required performing the role. We conduct such test as per the requirements of 
the organization and provide them with detailed report</p>
        <h5 class="u-align-left u-text u-text-9"> Manuals, Content and SOP development:</h5>
        <p class="u-text u-text-10"> Rules, standard operating procedures, different manuals etc. are useful business tools as they communicate the 
correct ways of carrying out an activity, the do's and don'ts of that activity etc.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>These tools provide us with the consistency, reduction of errors and proper communication. We create these 
documents for the clients after thoroughly analysing the working patterns of the firm thus ensuring 100% 
compliance and uninterrupted and failure free business process.
